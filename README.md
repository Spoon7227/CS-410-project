# Text Sentiment Highlighter - Chrome Extension

## Overview

**Text Sentiment Highlighter** is a Chrome extension designed to analyze and visually highlight the sentiment of selected text on any webpage. It determines the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral, or mixed) of the text that the user has selected, then applies a colored highlight (green, red, none, orange) on the selected text. This tool is useful for navigating web pages by quickly filtering and understanding textual content based on sentiments. This tool is particularly useful in social media feeds, news articles, blog posts, or any website where textual content and human conversations are prominent. 

## Implementation

The extension is implemented using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and utilizes `compendium-js` for the sentiment analysis part. It follows a standard Chrome extension structure:

- **Manifest File**: `manifest.json` outlines the extension's settings, including permissions, scripts, and other Chrome Extension-related configurations.
- **Background Script**: `background.js` (service worker) acts as a central message handler, coordinating messages between content scripts and the popup by maintaining states.
- **Content Script**: `content.js` is responsible for performing the sentiment analysis on the selected text on the webpage and sending the results back to the popup.
- **Popup**: `popup.html` and `popup.js` create a user interface that appears when the user clicks on the extension icon. It displays the selected text and the sentiment analysis result.
